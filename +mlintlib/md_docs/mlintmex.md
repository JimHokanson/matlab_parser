## mlintmex calling formats ##

When the file_path contains non-ascii characters apparently this format is needed ...

    mlintmex(file_string,file_path,'-text',options{:})




Note: These might be better as a set of examples of calling mlintmex





- Can pass in either a string or filepath (requires '-text' switch)
  - string still requires filename as 2nd input, for non-ascii filenames
- More than one filename can be passed in for the first set of inputs. This is done by multiple input positions, not by a cellstr to the first input


When given multiple files, the outputs are returned with the name of the
function.
