## Matlab Parser ##

This repository might need to be renamed. This repository is meant to serve as a basis for three goals.

Goal 1: Parse Matlab code for function dependencies. More on this later (depfun vs fdep vs my own implementation).

Goal 2: Parse Matlab code to assist with metaclass like code execution. In particular I would like to be able to enhance the display of Matlab classes by using markup instructions in comments.

Goal 3: Provide enhanced help through error analysis in conjunction with parsing of the offending line.

## Components ##

Right now I am working on documenting the mlintmex code. For some starting information on this topic see:
