## Antlr ##
[http://www.antlr.org/](http://www.antlr.org/)

This is a serious piece of software. Perhaps we should use this?


## m2html ##
[http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/](http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/)

- Written in Matlab but with poor class support. 
- This is a very popular option for providing html summary documentation


## highlight ##
[http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/highlight/](http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/highlight/)

- Yikes. 
- This looks like mainly Matlab code but it causes me pain to look at it.
- Written by the same person/group that wrote m2html


## mtoc++   FEX:33826 ##

FEX 33826](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33826-mtoc++-doxygen-filter-for-matlab-and-tools)

- This is a serious bit of code at somehow forces Matlab code into being parsed by doxygen.

[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25925-using-doxygen-with-matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25925-using-doxygen-with-matlab)

- This one is more popular than mtoc++ based on downloads ...
- Not sure what to think of this ...

## mparser FEX:32769 ##
[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32769-mparser](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32769-mparser)

- has some interesting setups for tests
- relies on ANTLR
- seems complicated to setup
- not finished

- parses script (??? other file types???) and documents what functions are called
- key technology: mlint calls
- written completely in Matlab

## fparser 3915 ##
[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3915-fparser-a-pedestrian-m-file-parser-and-tokenizer](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/3915-fparser-a-pedestrian-m-file-parser-and-tokenizer)

- old version of parsing code written by same author that did **farg**
- OBSOLETE

[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9594-mgrep](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9594-mgrep)

- John D'Errico
- Returns the names of all m-files in a directory or directory tree that contain a search string

## 23306 towards development toolbox ## 
[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23306](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23306)

- There is nothing really here for this one. Perhaps the person got frustrated ...?

## Doctest for Matlab ##
[https://bitbucket.org/tgs/doctest-for-matlab/src](https://bitbucket.org/tgs/doctest-for-matlab/src)
 
- The idea of this software is to embed test cases in the code itself.
